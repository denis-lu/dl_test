todo convert to test rule
todo review coverage once again , it still misses some .
todo num - this does not seem correct - we don ' t check the leniency of the stubbing itself , only mock - level settings we should also check if we can pass mock creation settings or mocking details directly to avoid ' mockingdetails ( ) ' method overhead
todo num - do we need to have the strictness check here ?
todo num this should be ( and below , too ) & & s . getstrictness ( ) = = strictness . strict_stubs ;
todo num let ' s just do lenient ( ) for simpler api ?
todo num : consider renaming lenient ( ) - > optional ( )
todo num , strictness . lenient - > we want to do the same thing for getunusedstubbingsbylocation ( )

todo sf ( perf tweak ) replace with mockitomock ( see mockitomock javadoc )

todo exception message , use reporter , javadoc for exception
todo make it better , it ' s easy to forget to clean up mocks and we still create new instance of list that nobody will read , it ' s also duplicated

todo # 793 - when completed , we should be able to get rid of the creationsettings casting below
todo when making this public , we should have an event object instead of num arguments in the listener .
todo update other tests that validate rule error handling so that they use this class .
todo find out if we really need javadocexclude . why don ' t we just exclude internal packages using gradle api ( javadoc . exclude ) ?
todo very implicit , it needs to go to some tools for release , for example , " releasetools . git "
todo if system . env . travis_branch is empty , just pick up current branch from git
todo move to gittool
todo allow only one of those
todo i don ' t like the fact that the previous version is taken from the release notes document get it from the version . properties ! if there is no previous version in version properties , add it during the version bump

todo sf move ' javadoc ' to src and make ' src ' - > ' src / main / java '
todo sf does not seem to have test coverage . what is the expected value when type mockable
todo sf potentially not needed
todo : javadoc
todo sf add unit tests and integ test coverage for describeto ( )
todo sf this is awkward , it should be : ( string ) " x "
todo sf enable when # 154 is implemented let ' s make those tests not use hamcrest
todo regarding javadoc
todo sf lets not use excludedtasknames to model this
todo sf push this message down
todo sf avoid leaking closure here as the release steps should be a java tool
todo sf this can be now unit tested
todo :
todo consider adding a separate source set or project that validates that switcher can disable a plugin
todo sf , decide how to handle it and ensure the there is a top level integ test for the mockingdetails ( ) . getinvocations ( ) asserttrue ( new mockitocore ( ) . mockingdetails ( null ) . getinvocations ( ) . isempty ( ) ) ;
todo sf find out if it is useful if ( modifier . isprivate ( type . getdeclaredconstructor ( enclosing ) . getmodifiers ( ) ) ) {
todo sf , spy is determined by default answer
todo sf prevent
todo sf use jcabi to edit issues after the release so that they have the milestone attached compile " com . jcabi : jcabi - github : 0 . 17 "
todo we could guess the best author from the ones associated with given email we could base on existence of space ( this hints that it ' s a proper first name + surname )
todo sf - i don ' t think we really need creationsettings type
todo below does not seem right
todo sf - borrowed code , not very nice , should not write to system out and should throw decent exceptions
todo sf coverage
todo sf duplicated , reuse service
todo sf coverage
todo sf replace with realmethod and get rid of ( possibly ) .
todo :
todo sf allow dry - running the release
todo sf mockito - all jar should automatically appear as downloadable in bintray and in mockito num . 0 , replaced with zip distro
todo sf change the package name in bintray from ' mockito ' to ' org . mockito '
todo sf ensure this one is released , too ( ensure source and target compatibility , too ) .
todo sf now that the code live under buildsrc try fixing this configuration - time hack
todo we could guess the best author from the ones associated with given email we could base on existence of space ( this hints that it ' s a proper first name + surname )
todo we should query for all tickets via one rest call and stop using jcapi
todo uncomment
todo tag should contain updated release notes . update notes on tag and cherry - pick to master .
todo work in progress printissuesbetween ( getpreviousversion ( ) , " 1 . 10 . 29 - dev " )
todo we don ' t need this , we infer changes from tags
todo generate to different dir , disable vanilla javadoc task
todo we should remove all dependencies to checked - in jars and move the ' mockito - all ' project out we should consider getting rid of mockito - all completely ( or moving out into a completely separate project .
todo remove - dev hack once we ' re happy with releases
todo why we need this method ? the other thenreturn covers it .
todo sf - this whole lot can be moved capturefrom implementation
todo use our own mockito mock serialization exception
todo duplicated with file
todo sf validate if this is a correct repo via hg
todo sf assert clean copy

todo get rid when debug ( ) finally is out
todo this needs documentation and further analysis - what if someone changes the answer ? we might think about implementing it straight on mocksettings
todo those tests should only deal with mocks
todo get rid of
todo interface for tests
todo use widely
todo : javadoc
todo : serializable ( ) should simply add serializable interface
todo : do the right thing with eq ( ) matcher and arrays
todo refactor back to cglibhacker and get rid of abstract class

todo after num . 7 refactor it to override - and - subclass
todo related to enhancement num
todo implement after num . 7 when ( mock . listargmethod ( anylistof ( string . class ) ) ) . thenreturn ( " list " ) ;

todo fix the message
todo merge with wantedinvocationcount , use enum to preserve atleast mode
todo make sure tests for mockito run quickly on slower machines
todo implement timeout verify ( mock , atleastonce ( ) . timeout ( 100 ) ) . clear ( ) ;
todo hacky
todo allow other classloaders here
todo add isnotnull ( ) matcher
todo ideally we should get matchers first so that invocation doesn ' t have to expand varargs matchersbinder then would become argumentsbinder
todo think about a test that can cover this scenario
todo implement me ! stubvoid ( mock )
todo null check
todo for every case when wanted and actual are shown , the arg list has to be consistently printed ( e . g . if one invocation is multiline , the the other one has to to be printed in multilines as well )
todo get rid of matchers and use assertors to investigate the idea and make testing simpler
todo can i somehow cache mocks created for some classes ?
todo this should return by type first ( if exist )
todo it should be argumentsaredifferent not argumentsaredifferentexception ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
todo sort out imports ! in order ?
todo can ' t you use matchers from hamcrest ?
todo unit
todo better error reporting - important case
todo " )
todo don ' t like ll coz it ' s too slow : )
todo what if interface has equals ( ) method to stub ?
todo every matcher should have a link to documentation about matchers
todo make custommatcher part of framework
todo should be similar pattern to mp
todo create specific nointeractionswantederror ?
todo start all with find
todo find out if the bottom code has any sense ( it ' s easymock ' s legacy ) and if we can replace it with arrays . equals ( )
todo merge with invalidusagetest
todo change this class to registeredinvocations that we can as about different stuff so behavior can verify based on answers
